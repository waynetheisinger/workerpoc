/**
 * Concept of Worker Threads:
 * --------------------------
 * Node.js runs JavaScript on the V8 engine in a single-threaded event loop, 
 * which can be a performance bottleneck when handling CPU-bound tasks. 
 * Worker threads allow Node.js to execute JavaScript in parallel on separate threads.
 * This can significantly improve performance for CPU-intensive operations 
 * without blocking the main event loop. Each worker thread runs in its own V8 
 * instance and has its own isolated memory.
 * 
 * For more information on Worker Threads, refer to the official Node.js documentation:
 * https://nodejs.org/api/worker_threads.html
 */

/**
 * Concept of Message Queues:
 * --------------------------
 * Message queues provide an asynchronous communication mechanism for different 
 * parts of a system to send messages between them. In the context of our app, 
 * a message queue (implemented by Bull) allows us to offload intensive processing 
 * tasks to a separate process or thread, ensuring the main application remains responsive.
 * The main app adds tasks (or messages) to the queue, and worker processes or threads 
 * pick up and process these tasks. This architecture efficiently distributes processing 
 * load and decouples the main app from the processing logic.
 * 
 * For more information on Bull and its underlying concepts, visit:
